This is a file for evaluating the code:

Speed:
Let's get the obvious out of the way.
With higher max time, it takes much longer for the code to complete the simulation.
Other input parameter factors such as number density, density fraction, does not affect the speed of the program on a\
observable level.
The more interesting effect is the one caused by the integrator type.
Depending on which integrater you choose, the result will different.
Due to time constraint, I was not able to test the code with most of the integrator and \
and indeed I have no idea how most of them works.
But with the ones that I have tested, I can conclude that there is an observable effect on the integration speed and percision.
The default integrator is the most friendly one.
It has a internal time step check where if the integration will diverge under the current time step it will\
adjust the time step to appropriate value.

Equilibrium:
A low and high temperature, the equilibrium is achieved faster.
However, the equilibrium is achieved much slower at medium temperature.

Sadly, no interesting phase space is observed at least in my opinion.

Getting through the equations are relatively easy and writing the reaction rate module is easy. 
However, there is a lot of thing that need to be determined to change temperature and time step.
It took some time to decide what place should I do this, in the main program or in the rhs program.
Eventually, the desicion is made to do everthing in the rhs module for sake of easy access to information.
